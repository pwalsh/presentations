# What

- A small workshop for beginners
- Basic techniques for working with (open) data
- Constructing a narrative with data, code and text

---

# Why

- Learning to code is inherently abstract
- Make it concrete with small, simple projects
- It can be empowering to conduct inquiries about the world around us

---

# How

- Learn three basic categories of action with data
- Share open data resources that cover a range of topics
- Explore a specific line of inquiry, and present some other ideas

---

# Tools

- Open Data ([definition](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) and [resources](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/opendataprojects/README.md#resources))
- Open source (some simple [notebooks](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/opendataprojects))
- An inquisitive mind!

---

# Actions

Work with raw data sources is based on a few simple categories of action.

- *Requesting* data from the source
- *Analysing* the data once "loaded"
- *Visualising* particular "views" on the data

---

# Request

A file, a database, a web page.

- [View the notebook](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/opendataprojects/request.ipynb)

---

# Analyse

Glean knowledge from data.

- [View the notebook](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/opendataprojects/analyse.ipynb)

---

# Visualise

Share knowledge about the data.

- [View the notebook](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/opendataprojects/visualise.ipynb)

---

# Inquiry

Make an inquiry using open data.

- [View the notebook](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/opendataprojects/inquiry.ipynb)
