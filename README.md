## Open Data Projects

Learning to program can be easier when you have a problem to solve. This presentation was used as part of a workshop I led at [PyConUK 2016](http://2016.pyconuk.org/workshops/open-data-projects-with-python/), and accompanied a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/blob/master/opendataprojects/README.md) with code examples.

The workshop targeted beginners who may benefit from some simple examples of working with open data to answer real world questions or problems.
