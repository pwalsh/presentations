# Presentations

## Open Data Projects

Learning to program can be easier when you have a problem to solve. This presentation is used for a workshop targeting beginners, who may benefit from some simple examples of working with open data to answer real world questions or problems. There is an accompanying [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/blob/master/opendataprojects/README.md) with code examples.

This presentation was used as part of a workshop I led at [PyConUK 2016](http://2016.pyconuk.org/workshops/open-data-projects-with-python/).

## Open Data and the Question of Quality

In 2017, discourse around open data still revolves around publication of open data. While clearly important, it is like talking about building roads without thought towards their ability to facilitate transport. We need a shift in focus towards data quality in order to facilitate the ability to *use* open data.

This presentation will be given at [csv,conf,v3](https://csvconf.com).
