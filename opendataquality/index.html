"What's next in open data? The limits of the publication discourse"
</p>

<p>
Blurb:
</p>

<p>
In 2017, discourse around open data still revolves around publication of open data. While clearly important, it is like talking about building roads without thought towards their ability to facilitate transport. We need a radical shift in discourse towards data quality in order to facilitate the ability to use open data.
</p>

<p>
The talk will cover a little history to show the historical forces that got us to where we are today - lots of open data portals full of barely reusable data, and present a vision for where we need to be and how we could get there, in order for open data to truly fulfil its promise as a channel of empowerment.

<p>
If we are going to talk about open data and the question of quality, Let's first briefly discuss why the quality of open data is important to me.
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm the <b>Chief Product Officer</b> at Open Knowledge International [ <a href="https://okfn.org">https://okfn.org</a> ]</li>

<li>Open Knowledge International, founded by Rufus Pollock in 2004, has a history deeply intwined with open data as we understand it today.</li>

<li>We've both led, and been deeply involved in, a number of key efforts around the open data space:

<ul>
<li><b>Open Definition</b> [ <a href="http://opendefinition.org">http://opendefinition.org</a> ]: The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content.</li>

<li><b>CKAN</b> [ <a href="https://ckan.org">https://ckan.org</a> ]: The first and leading open data portal, used by governments and other publishing bodies around the world.</li>

<li><b>Global Open Data Index</b> [ <a href="http://index.okfn.org">http://index.okfn.org</a> ]: Measuring the openness of goverments by way of their open data publication.</li>

<li>A range of other open source apps, libraries and platforms for open data, like:
<ul>
<li><b>Frictionless Data</b> [ <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io">https://frictionlessdata.io</a> ]</li>
<li><b>OpenSpending</b> [ <a href="https://openspending.org">https://openspending.org</a> ]</li>
<li><b>OpenTrials</b> [ <a href="https://explorer.opentrials.net">https://explorer.opentrials.net</a> ]</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

<li>We love open data, and most importantly, want to see it drive change in the world. This is important to the context of the talk around publication and quality.</li>

<li>Me, I'm a hacker with a background in anthropology</li>

<li>We have a clear definition of what open data is.</li>
<li>The definition I am using is from the Open Data Charter. It is in turn based on earlier work from OKI and others on the Open Definition.</li>
<li>While the definition applies to data in general, it is still mostly used in the context of government data. This is changing (Open Trials example), but the examples in this talk are also related to government data.</li>

<p>
Before we talk about the state of open data, and open data quality, we need to define what we mean by open data.

"Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose"

"The Open Definition makes precise the meaning of “open” with respect to knowledge, promoting a robust commons in which anyone may participate, and interoperability is maximized."

</ul>

<ol>
<li>Let's stop here for a second and ask: Why is Open Data important?</li>
<li>Our governments should be accountable to us. Publishing data on what they do is an important form of accountability.</li>
<li>Open data, on top of infrastructure like the Internet, feeds new participatory cultures. Activists, NGOs, businesses, etc.</li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p>
From the Open Data Charter <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/principles/">http://opendatacharter.net/principles/</a> :
</p>

<p>
"Open data enables governments, citizens, and civil society and private sector organizations to make better informed decisions"
</p>

<p>
"We, the adherents to the International Open Data Charter, recognize that governments and other public sector organizations hold vast amounts of data that may be of interest to citizens, and that this data is an underused resource. Opening up government data can encourage the building of more interconnected societies that better meet the needs of our citizens and allow innovation, justice, transparency, and prosperity to flourish, all while ensuring civic participation in public decisions and accountability for governments."
</p>

<p>
"Open data allows user to compare, combine, and follow the connections among different datasets, tracing data across a number of programs and sectors. When data can be effectively combined and compared, it can help highlight trends, identify social and economic challenges and inequities, and benchmark progress in public programs and services."
</p>


<p>
So, one thing is clear: it is important, but not in and of itself. Open data is a means to an end. open data is important in correspondenence with the change it can affect in the world.

<ol>
<li>Open data movement is an established ecosystem or "industry".</li>
<li>Governments are eager to tie open data into their transparency efforts.</li>
<li>While this growth is a net positive, there are troubling issues with open data quality that are not being addressed at the government level (still pre-ccupied with publication, and the ecosystem incentivises this).</li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p>
It's 2017 and we are 10 years in to open data. Over that time, an entire movement has established itself with reference to government data specifically, but also a more general idea of open data. Of course, refering to this time from does not mean all data was "closed" before this period.
</p>

<p>
However, the digital economy afforded by the World Wide Web and other technological advancements truly gave rise to an entity and concept in its own right, one that is now represented via a range of CSOs, coalitions like the Open Government Partnership, and initiatives like the Open Data Charter.
</p>

<p>
Is open data as a concept and a force healthy? Is the promise of open data being fulfilled? Can we see clearly where open data needs to go?

<li>Particularly clear requirements and a willing, capable and funded team internally.</li>
<li>A mixture of automated and manually generated data. Decentralised data collection and publication.</li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p>
In late 2014, I worked on a project at OKI in collaboration with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office/about">Cabinet Office</a> around measuring the UK government's transparency efforts around spending. Many of the core tools that are now part of the Frictionless Data toolchain came out of this work.
</p>

<p>
A primary goal was to look at spend publishing, particularly data we referred to as the UK "25k" data, check the quality of the data published, and build a dashboard for internal stakeholders to see and measure their own fiscal transparency and data publication status.
</p>

<p>
The "25k" data is interesting for a number of reasons.
</p>

<p>
For one, the data covers a wide range of administrative departments across central government, detailing their spending on any items with a value of over £25,000.
</p>

<p>
More interestingly, the publication of this data was a top-down initiative, stemming from an order by the Prime Minister in May 2010 that each department will have a minister responsible for transparency, and that this was tied directly to accountaibility and driving down costs.
</p>

<p>
As part of this initiative, the government made a commitment to publish details of all expenditure over £25,000, and the giveronment released fairly detailed and clear guidance for how this data was to be published. Read more on this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198197/Guidance_for_publishing_spend_over__25k.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here we have an example of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A requirement to publish open data</li>
<li>A need driven by transparency and accountability narratives</li>
<li>Clear, simple information for all departments on how to prepare and release this data</li>
<li>Data that has a "standard" -  a very explicit description of the fields and type of data to be released (see an extraction of this standard from the above linked document <a href="https://gist.github.com/pwalsh/a9f7f0796229d0566191">here</a>).</li>

</ul>

<p>
So, just how good is the data?
</p>

<p>
Our scripts for collecting and processing the data, as well as copies of the data, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/okfn/data-quality-uk-25k-spend">Github</a>. <a href="https://github.com/okfn/data-quality-uk-25k-spend/blob/master/README.md">The README.md</a> file contains a detailed description of what we did, how we defined "data quality" in this context, and explains to process by which we acquired the data.
</p>


<p>
Note that the quality problems start with the discoverability of the data itself. There is no way via any UK government portal to simply collect all this data via an existing taxonomy. We had to write custom code on top of the CKAN search API (data.gov.uk runs on CKAN) to try to find all UK25k data. Logic for this can be found in <a href="https://github.com/okfn/data-quality-uk-25k-spend/blob/master/scripts/id_data.py#L292">this function</a> and other functions in <a href="https://github.com/okfn/data-quality-uk-25k-spend/blob/master/scripts/id_data.py">this module</a>.
</p>

<p>
However, our story, today, is not about the discoverability of the data as such, but the quality of the data itself.
</p>

<p>
To get to the point, we have a display of the latest results available on an instance of our <a href="http://uk-25k.herokuapp.com">Data Quality Dashboard for this data</a>. By the scoring system we used, less than 1% (rounded to 0) of the data meets the UK governments own quality standards for this data.
</p>

<p>
Here is an <a href="http://goodtables.okfnlabs.org/reports?data_url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532146/dwp-payments-over-25000-for-may-2016.csv&amp;format=csv&amp;encoding=&amp;schema_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okfn/goodtables/master/examples/hmt/spend-publishing-schema.json">example of the errors found</a>, in a file for May 2016 from the Depaertment of Work and Pensions. You can find similar errors elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
We should allow for some margin of error in our analysis. As we've said - it is not possible to deterministically get all UK25k data by each department.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that some data is available on other UK data portals (not data.gov.uk), it is possible that we could not find some data (due to the way we have to use search queries to discover data), it is possible we'veerroneously identified some data (ditto), and so on.
</p>

<p>
By analysing the errors that persist over this data, one sees patterns that are common fodder for civic tech data wranglers:
</p>

<ul>
<li>columns with inconsistent data (example: strings in data columns)</li>
<li>blank rows</li>
<li>non-tabular data at the beginning and end of files</li>
<li>inconsistent header naming</li>

</p>

<p>
In 2016, we undertook a project with Open Knowledge Germany to bring together a large subsection of EU subsidy data, and centralise it into the OpenSpending database for deeper analysis. 
</p>

<p>
We knew this was not a small job: there are data standards and regulations at the EU for the publication of this data, but there are not consistently adhered to. We set out to identify and source around 140 different datasets, across a range of regional data portals. Like wit the UK example, the data quality issues already start at the discovery stage - it is a significant amount of work just to <b>identify</b> where this "open data" can be found. 
</p>

<p>
In this "data sourcing" stage we experienced the next step of data quality - while the data is supposed to be published in open data formats, much wasn't. In the end we extracted data from formats X, Y, and Z, and from over X different data portals across Europe.

"Being able to access bogus data is pointless. What is needed to make sense of the world around us is better data, free from government interference. To be free to contextualize news, free to interpret events and free to think independently, we need independently collected data.
</p>

<p>
This is important because good information is a prerequisite for the bureaucracy to run properly. Removing good data is like removing the foundations of our administrations. And this is already happening."

<p>
In reaching for quality, we need to understand the essential foundations, and not introduce layers of complexity that delay and even prevent publication.
</p>

<p>
Note that here the foundations I'm claiming are simpler than those implied by the Open Data Charter, which talks about higher-level concepts such as "linkability" and "comparability". DEFRA in the UK government also publishes some open data principles along the same lines.
</p>

<p>
I'm concerned that these focus too much on the concepts and technology of Linked Data, and miss out on a more foundational step.
</p>

<p>
Also, these types of declarations and principles are almost exclusively concerned with the consumption of open data, largely ignoring the production of open data. This has implications related to the technologising of solutions, that I'll talk about shortly.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line is, without a simple, solid foundation of <b>structural integrity</b>, <b>schematic consistency</b>, and <b>timely release</b>, we will not meet quality standards higher up in the chain.

<li>I'm a big fan of all of these things, and actively working on some (data standards). I'm also a big fan of scoping and iterative progress. These are nice things that we can't have yet.</li>
<li>Some of this is better done by domain experts or towards specific ends (e.g.: OpenSpending and fiscal data). Generic code list and linking solutions are bound to fall short for a great many use cases.</li>
<li>Solutions to these non-goals are inherently technical (part of their appeal to some). Classic case of engineering solving a problem. Just yesterday XKCD published a comiic on this tendency. I think we are seeing the same type of thing with some approaches around Linked Open Data.</li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p>
I am a big fan of all of these things. We should, as an ecosystem, be moving towards these things consistently. However, they should be based only on the previous foundations.
</p>

<p>
All of these things take us away from basic plain text publication of data, and introduce complexities via increased dependance on <b>technology</b> and <b>domain knowledge</b>.
</p>

<p>
We need to have essential quality assurances in plain text publication of data first, for data that is published via manual and automated means.
</p>

<p>
Why we should work to all of these on top of the previous foundations:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Data standards</b>: Technologists love standards (me too! I work on a few). Data can be published and standardaized without standards (FDP example).</li>

<li><b>Code lists</b>: Technologists love code lists.
<ul>
<li>Most humans have no idea what we are talking about. (problem of complexity in production.)</li>
<li>Almost all data cannot be mapped 1:1 to common code lists. (problem of compelxity related to regulation, law, and so on.)</li>

</ul></li>

<li><b>Comparison</b>: Comparison is extremely hard across even very similar datasets. (example: of muni fiscal data and changes across entities - different usage of same code - and over time,)</li>

<li><b>Linkage</b>: Things not strings is a common phrase used by Linked Data proponents. We are all working towards this, but it is again incredibly domain specific. Similar end goals can be achieved through simpler quality mechanisms.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Lastly, a lot of this comes out of context: data published tp the basic quality foundations above allows domain experts to do these things in more specific and granular ways, for their goals.

What can we do to get governments to publish quality open data?
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm not here solely to complain about the current situation of open data!</li>
<li>Governments need us, the consumers of their open data, to be vocal and guiding in increasting the quality of open data.</li>
<li>This is not a problem space with a purely technological solution.</li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p>
What actions can we, open data activists, hackers, and so on, take now to get governments to publish quality open data?
</p>

<p>
I don't believe in technical solutions to issues that are socio-political in nature.
</p>

<p>
Governments, or more specifically the transparency and open data arms within them, think they are on the right track with data publication and it is up to us, the consumers of that data, to make them painfully aware of the shortcomings of what is currently being published.
</p>

<p>
We can't do this only by coding software. We can develop some solutions in software, that need to be leveraged by civic tech (etc.) to show their governments (at all levels) and serve as the basis for a discussion of change - a change to value data quality as part of the data publication process.
